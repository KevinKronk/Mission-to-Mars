# Mission to Mars with Web Scraping

## Purpose

We are helping Robin use web scraping to collect information about Mars. In the first part we are collecting article titles and previews from https://redplanetscience.com/ that will let her know the news about Mars. In the second part we are scraping Mars temperature data from a table at https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html. This will provide us with Curiosity Rover data for each day it has been on Mars, including the minimum temperature and pressure data it has collected at it's current location. We will use this to answer questions about how many months and days there are on Mars, the coldest and warmest months, and the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars.
